# Elevent to Twenty

(it's called that because 11-20 are a pita to remember, and ironically missing from this site)

I vibe coded all of this. I don't know javascript, and was only able to massage this to a point where it ran.

Why do this?

- I'm trying to practice my ASL from a great class I took.
- I couldn't find a one size fits all solution that existed already. All the flash card websites I found handled videos horribly, and all the ASL practice websites I found didn't have all the words I was trying to remember.
- I wanted to give vibe coding a shot and see what inhuman monstrosity I could come up with.

Is this good? No, but it works for me. I hope it works for you too. Cheers

I'm going to deploy it to my CF, and if the costs get out of control I'll close it off.
